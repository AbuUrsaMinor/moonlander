# Moonlander Game Requirements (v1.0)

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a modern web-based rendition of the classic Moonlander game. The application will be built using React, TypeScript, and Vite, featuring a sleek and professional design implemented with Tailwind CSS.

## Game Description
Moonlander is a spacecraft simulation game where players attempt to safely land a lunar module on the moon's surface. The game challenges players to manage their spacecraft's thrust and orientation while dealing with gravity and limited fuel.

## Technical Requirements

### Platform & Technologies
- Built as a Progressive Web Application (PWA)
- Mobile-first design approach
- Developed using React and TypeScript
- Utilizes Vite as the build tool
- Styled using Tailwind CSS v4
- Deployable to GitHub Pages
- Responsive design optimized for mobile devices
- Offline playability through PWA capabilities
- Device Sensors Integration:
  - Accelerometer for tilt controls
  - Device orientation detection
  - Permission handling for device sensors
  - Fallback controls when sensors unavailable

### Core Game Mechanics

#### Physics Simulation

  - Calibration option for neutral position
  - Adjustable tilt sensitivity
  - Device orientation permission handling
  
Alternative Mobile Controls:
- Large touch areas for optimal mobile interaction
- Virtual joystick for rotation control
- Dedicated thrust button positioned for easy thumb access
- Gesture support for pause/resume (swipe up)

Desktop Controls:
- Thrust control (Up arrow or Space bar)
- Rotation control (Left and Right arrows)
- Visual and haptic feedback for all controls
- Adjustable control sensitivity
- Automatic control scheme detection based on device

Control Settings:
- Option to switch between tilt and touch controls
- Control scheme preference stored locally
- Real-time control scheme switching

### User Interface
